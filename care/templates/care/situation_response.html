    <h1>Situations and Responses</h1>
    <div class="column1of3">
        <h3>Anger/Violence</h3>
        <p>
           <ol>
 <li><strong>Hair pulling/hitting:</strong> Use the 'voice' of someone on par, as they may have regressed in age,
    while calling upon the words of a trusted adult, ie a parent, allowing the situation to shift
    the childlike state into respecting a known authority.
     <em>Example: "My Mom says it isn't nice to...."</em></li><br>

 <li><strong>Accusations:</strong> The patient may notice something missing and is assuming someone stole it.
    Understand that they cannot recall where they put or if item has been gone a long
    time. Trying to rationalize will not help. Ask if they would like help searching for the item.</li><br>

<li><strong>Bear in mind that distress leads to other emotions.</strong> The issue of wanting to 'go home' may rise
    due to the patients longing for a time when they had more control over their own life. Creating a to-do ‘we will have to do x,
    but first let’s do y’ is a distraction. This will help shift the moment and the mood.</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="column2of3">
        <h3>Memory Loss/Age Regression</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Imagine how frightening it would be to lose your memory.</strong>
                Due to age regression, you may be now dealing with a child or teen mentally and/or emotionally.
                Their attention span may be different, not to mention the fact that hearing may also be an issue!
        Try not to have a lot of loud noise such as the TV or stereo playing when trying to speak with them. Use
                their name and speak slowly & clearly. Keep in mind that the music or TV choice can affect the patients mood.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Try not to give the person multiple tasks at any given time.</strong> ‘Please wipe your face.’ is a simple, actionable request. If the
        patient is reluctant, remain kind but firm. If they want to go outside, let them know that will happen as soon as they
        do the requested action. </li><br>

            <li><strong> Try to engage them as you would someone the age of the storyteller.</strong> If the patient
                is telling a story from the point of view of a different age, simply listen.
                Telling them that they are 80 when they believe they are 25 will simply upset them. </li><br>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="column3of3">
        <h3>Fear/Sadness</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Redirecting and Storytelling.</strong> Should the patient become upset because they cannot
                find someone who may have passed on, you could say “I know you miss X very much.
                I know they love you and wish they could be here with you.” You could also ask them
                to tell you about the person he has asked about is a better way to calm a person with dementia. </li><br>

            <li><strong>If they are focusing on something negative,</strong> you might try to ask them to tell you about a specific event
                from the past in which they were happy, for example, their wedding day. Choosing one particular moment
                is better than a broad scope. <em>Example: “Will you tell me about....?" </em> </li><br>
            <li><strong>If they are feeling especially fearful,</strong> for example, not wanting to sleep alone in the dark, you can
                offer to sit and hold their hand or simply to sit next to them while they fall asleep. If they
                would prefer, offer to leave on a light and/or create white noise.
</li>
